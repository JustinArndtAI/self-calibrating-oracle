The Self-Calibrating Oracle
Project Mission: To prove, through a pure software simulation, that a Causal Oracle (a predictive physics model) can autonomously calibrate its internal parameters to match an unknown "ground truth" environment.

This repository contains the source code, experimental notebooks, and the accompanying ArXiv paper for this project.
