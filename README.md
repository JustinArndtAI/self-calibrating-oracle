A Self-Calibrating Causal Oracle for Physics-Based Simulation
This repository contains the complete source code and a corresponding ArXiv-ready paper for a project that demonstrates a self-calibrating physics simulation. The core idea is to prove that a simulation's internal model (a "Causal Oracle") can automatically correct its own physical parameters (like friction) by observing outcomes from a "ground truth" environment.

The entire project is self-contained and runs without any expensive hardware, using a two-simulator approach to validate the calibration logic.

Key Features
Pure Simulation Approach: Solves the calibration problem entirely in software, making it cost-free and easily reproducible.

Calibration Engine: A simple yet powerful binary search algorithm that efficiently finds the correct physical parameters.

Demonstrable Results: The script clearly shows the initial divergence and the step-by-step convergence process.

Paper & Visualization: Automatically generates a convergence plot and includes a complete, formatted LaTeX paper ready for submission to ArXiv.

Final Result
The calibration engine successfully converged on the true hidden friction parameter in just 9 iterations, reducing the final parameter error to less than 0.05%. The process is visualized in the plot below, which is automatically generated by the main script.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Git

A LaTeX distribution (e.g., MiKTeX, MacTeX) is required to compile the paper, but not to run the simulation.

Installation & Running
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/JustinArndtAI/self-calibrating-oracle.git](https://github.com/JustinArndtAI/self-calibrating-oracle.git)
cd self-calibrating-oracle

Create and activate a virtual environment:

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the complete simulation and generate the plot:

python main.py

After running the script, the console will display the output from all phases, and the convergence plot will be saved to paper/figures/calibration_convergence.png.

Project Structure
/paper: Contains the LaTeX source (main.tex) for the final paper and the generated figures.

/src: Contains the core Python source code for the Simulator and CalibrationEngine.

main.py: The main executable script that runs all phases of the project.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python dependencies.
