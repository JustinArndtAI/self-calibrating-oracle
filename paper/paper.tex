\begin{abstract}
% This paper introduces a novel framework for autonomous model calibration in simulated environments. We present a "Self-Calibrating Oracle," which leverages a dual-simulator architecture to iteratively refine its internal physics parameters by observing outcomes in a parallel "ground truth" world. Our results demonstrate that... (To be completed in Phase 1-3)

\section{Introduction}
The discrepancy between simulated models and physical reality, often termed the "sim-to-real gap," presents a significant challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence. An agent trained in a simulation with imperfect physics parameters will fail when its policies are deployed in the real world. This project addresses this problem at its core... (To be completed in Phase 1)

\section{Methodology}
Our approach is based on a dual-simulator architecture... (To be completed in Phase 1 & 2)

\subsection{Dual Simulator Architecture}
We instantiate two parallel instances of a 2D physics simulator...

\subsection{Calibration Algorithm}
The calibration process is driven by an iterative optimization algorithm...

\section{Experiments and Results}
To validate our approach, we designed an experiment to calibrate a single physics parameter: friction... (To be completed in Phase 3)

\section{Related Work}
System identification and sim-to-real transfer are well-established fields... (To be completed in Phase 4)

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have successfully demonstrated that a Causal Oracle can autonomously self-calibrate... (To be completed in Phase 4)
